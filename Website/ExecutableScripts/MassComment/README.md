# Mass Comment V3
This tool was initially private and designed solely for usage of `DVRKZ` members however it is no longer valued as it once was.

Config properties:
```
accounts - JSON Array key responsible for setting up your accounts that will be used by the script to spread
Setting multiple languages across accounts will improve its efficiency.
More accounts longer await time.

Presets - Allows you to set a specific message for each account (Intended usage for multi-language spread)

GameIDs - Array that lets you pick under what games to spread comments.
```

# Why no proxy?
Simply cause we do not care about getting banned. It's no big deal.
