# Token Logger & Input Stealer
> [!CAUTION]
> I do NOT condone usage of account stealers, this was a project that came up out of nowhere as a result of what-if. <br>
> This specific sample managed to log users `4,010` times resulting in around `66` accounts being infected within one and a half month.

Features:
- Read token similarly to [FindMyToken](https://github.com/absurdic/KoGaMa/tree/main/Exploits/FindMyToken)
