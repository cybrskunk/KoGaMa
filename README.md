# Update V3

As of September 22nd, 2025 I have officially given up on continuing the legacy of KoGaMa-Related contributions on my side. All files, those that I held private for my group of friends, as well as the unpublished releases are stored in here from today. Greetings from Simon and the entirety of DVRKZ.



~~##Update~~
~~4TH AUGUST 2024: UPDATE.~~
~~Due to the recent spike of activity in skidded stealers, my sample has been taken down. It was meant as an educational project, not a tool to be overshared and used for harm.  
The specific sample is the property of DVRKZ.~~
