# 4TH AUGUST 2024: UPDATE.
Due to the recent spike of activity in skidded stealers, my sample has been taken down. It was meant as an educational project, not a tool to be overshared and used for harm.  
The specific sample is the property of DVRKZ.

People who were seen using my sample to cause harm:  
- bialasss
- Inversion
- Foshon
- and a few different players who will not be named here. Giving you attention is not worth it. :)
