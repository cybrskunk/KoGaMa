# Note
[***archfrajer/KoGaMa***](https://github.com/archfrajer/KoGaMa/) is my secondary repository for KoGaMa (WWW) that holds random things, consisting of some scripts, themes and tools. <br>
Looking for KoGaMaBuddy Port I've made? Check out [***archfrajer/Utilify***](https://github.com/archfrajer/Utilify). <br> <br>

This repository will not be as maintained as Utilify is, even though I currently got no motivation for either, lmao.
